## Introduction to Modelica and Thermo-fluid Modeling with Applications from the Buildings Library

Instructor: David Blum, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

### Abstract: 

This workshop will give an introduction to the modeling of thermo-fluid systems and their control using Modelon Impact and the Modelica Buildings Library. We will be using applications from the Modelica Buildings Library, but the course will be structured to also appeal to modelers from other application domains that are concerned with thermo-fluid systems. After an introductory presentation that discusses the scope of the Modelica Buildings Library, we discuss best practices in setting up thermo-fluid flow models and how to avoid potential problems. In hands-on exercises, participants will build models of simple heating and air conditioning systems, link them to a thermal load, and add feedback control. The models will be built using components from the Modelica Buildings Library. Simulations will be run on Modelon Impact.

Duration: 3 hours
